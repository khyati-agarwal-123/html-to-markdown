### Diversity and Inclusion

Oracle is fully committed to diversity and inclusion. Oracle respects and
values having a diverse workforce that increases thought leadership and
innovation. As part of our initiative to build a more inclusive culture that
positively impacts our employees, customers, and partners, we are working to
remove insensitive terms from our products and documentation. We are also
mindful of the necessity to maintain compatibility with our customers'
existing technologies and the need to ensure continuity of service as Oracle's
offerings and industry standards evolve. Because of these technical
constraints, our effort to remove insensitive terms is ongoing and will take
time and external cooperation.
