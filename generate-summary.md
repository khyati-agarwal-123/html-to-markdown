## Generate Summary

In these examples, you can see how to summarize a given textual extract.

A summary is a short and concise extract with key features of a document that
best represents what the document is about as a whole. A summary can be free-
form paragraphs or bullet points based on the format that you specify.

Note:

You can also generate a summary using Oracle Database as the service provider.
In this case, Oracle Text is internally used to generate a summary. However,
that is outside the scope of these examples. See [Oracle Database PL/SQL
Packages and Types Reference](/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/database/oracle/oracle-
database/23/vecse&id=ARPLS-GUID-EC9DDB58-6A15-4B36-BA66-ECBA20D2CE57).

  * [Generate Summary Using Public REST Providers](generate-summary-using-public-third-party-apis.md)  
Perform a text-to-summary transformation, using publicly hosted third-party
text summarization models by Cohere, Google AI, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Vertex
AI, or Generative AI.

  * [Generate Summary Using the Local REST Provider Ollama](generate-summary-using-ollama.md)  
Perform a text-to-summary transformation by accessing open LLMs, using the
local host REST endpoint provider Ollama.
