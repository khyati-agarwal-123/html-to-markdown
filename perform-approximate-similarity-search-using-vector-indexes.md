## Perform Approximate Similarity Search Using Vector Indexes

For a vector search to be useful, it needs to be fast and accurate.
Approximate similarity searches seek a balance between these goals.

  * [Understand Approximate Similarity Search Using Vector Indexes](understand-approximate-similarity-search-using-vector-indexes.md)  
For faster search speeds with large vector spaces, you can use approximate
similarity search using vector indexes.

  * [Optimizer Plans for Vector Indexes](optimizer-plans-vector-indexes.md)  
Optimizer plans for HNSW and IVF indexes are described in the following
sections.

  * [Approximate Similarity Search Examples](approximate-similarity-search-examples.md)  
Review these examples to see how you can perform an approximate similarity
search using vector indexes.
