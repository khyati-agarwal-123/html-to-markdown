## Optimizer Plans for Vector Indexes

Optimizer plans for HNSW and IVF indexes are described in the following
sections.

  * [Optimizer Plans for HNSW Vector Indexes](optimizer-plans-hnsw-vector-indexes.md)  
A Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph (HNSW) is a form of In-Memory
Neighbor Graph vector index. It is a very efficient index for vector
approximate similarity search.

  * [Optimizer Plans for IVF Vector Indexes](optimizer-plans-ivf-vector-indexes.md)  
Inverted File Flat (IVF) is a form of Neighbor Partition Vector index. It is a
partition-based index that achieves search efficiency by narrowing the search
area through the use of neighbor partitions or clusters.

**Parent topic:** [Perform Approximate Similarity Search Using Vector
Indexes](perform-approximate-similarity-search-using-vector-indexes.md "For
a vector search to be useful, it needs to be fast and accurate. Approximate
similarity searches seek a balance between these goals.")
