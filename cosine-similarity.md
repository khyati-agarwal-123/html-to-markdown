## Cosine Similarity

One of the most widely used similarity metric, especially in natural language
processing (NLP), is cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle
between two vectors.

The smaller the angle, the more similar are the two vectors. Cosine similarity
measures the similarity in the direction or angle of the vectors, ignoring
differences in their size (also called magnitude). The smaller the angle, the
bigger is its cosine. So the cosine distance and the cosine similarity have an
inverse relationship. While cosine distance measures how different two vectors
are, cosine similarity measures how similar two vectors are.

"Measuring distances in a vector space is at the heart of identifying the most
relevant results for a given query vector. That process is very different from
the well-known keyword filtering in the relational database world.")
