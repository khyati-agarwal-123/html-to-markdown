## 9 Work with LLM-Powered APIs and Retrieval Augmentation Generation

You can use Vector Utility PL/SQL APIs for prompting Large Language Models
(LLMs) with textual prompts, using LLM-powered chat interfaces. You can also
communicate with LLMs through the implementation of Retrieval Augmentation
Generation (RAG), which helps to generate more accurate and informative
responses.

  * [Use LLM-Powered APIs to Generate Summaries and Text](use-llm-powered-apis-generate-summary-and-text.md)  
In these examples, you can see how to summarize a textual extract and provide
a descriptive answer for a given prompt.

  * [Use Retrieval Augmented Generation to Complement LLMs](use-retrieval-augmented-generation-complement-llms.md)  
RAG lets you mitigate the inaccuracies and hallucinations faced when using
LLMs. Oracle AI Vector Search enables RAG within Oracle Database using the
`DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN` PL/SQL package or through popular frameworks (such as
LangChain).
