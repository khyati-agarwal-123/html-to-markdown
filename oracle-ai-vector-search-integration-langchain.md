## Oracle AI Vector Search Integration with LangChain

LangChain is a powerful and flexible open source orchestration framework that
helps developers build applications that leverage the advanced capabilities of
large language models (LLMs).

LangChain provides essential tools for managing workflows, maintaining
context, and integrating with external systems. For example, the LangChain
framework allows you to create Chatbots and agent applications. LangChain
primarily supports Python but also has support for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oracle AI Vector Search integrates with LangChain at various levels:

  * Document Loaders
  * Text Splitter
  * Embeddings
  * Summary
  * Vector Store

For more information about each of these components, see [LangChain Oracle AI
Vector Search
documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/providers/oracleai/).

See Also:

  * [LangChain documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) for an introduction to the LangChain framwork 
  * [LangChain component documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/components/) for a list of LangChain components 
  * [LangChain installation documentation](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/how_to/installation/) to learn how to install LangChain packages in Python 
  * [Oracle AI Vector Search integration demo](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/master/cookbook/oracleai_demo.ipynb) for an end-to-end tutorial that demonstrates how Oracle AI Vector Search can be used with LangChain to serve as an end-to-end RAG pipeline 

**Parent topic:** [Use Retrieval Augmented Generation to Complement LLMs](use-

inaccuracies and hallucinations faced when using LLMs. Oracle AI Vector Search
enables RAG within Oracle Database using the DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN PL/SQL package
or through popular frameworks \(such as LangChain\).")
