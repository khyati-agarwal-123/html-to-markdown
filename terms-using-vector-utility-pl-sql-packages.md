## Terms of Using Vector Utility PL/SQL Packages

You must understand the terms of using REST APIs that are part of Vector
Utility PL/SQL packages.

Some of the Vector Utility PL/SQL APIs enable you to perform embedding,
summarization, and text generation operations outside Oracle Database, by
using third-party REST providers (such as Cohere, Google AI, Hugging Face,
Generative AI, OpenAI, or Vertex AI).

WARNING:

Certain features of the database may allow you to access services offered
separately by third-parties, for example, through the use of JSON
specifications that facilitate your access to REST APIs.

Your use of these features is solely at your own risk, and you are solely
responsible for complying with any terms and conditions related to use of any
such third-party services. Notwithstanding any other terms and conditions
related to the third-party services, your use of such database features
constitutes your acceptance of that risk and express exclusion of Oracle's
responsibility or liability for any damages resulting from such access.

packages-generate-embeddings.md "Choose to implement Vector Utility PL/SQL
packages to perform chunking, embedding, and text generation operations along
with text processing and similarity search, both within and outside the
database. The supplied PL/SQL packages for vector generation are DBMS_VECTOR
and DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN.")
