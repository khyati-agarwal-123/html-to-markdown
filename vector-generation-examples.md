## Vector Generation Examples

Run these end-to-end examples to see how you can generate vector embeddings,
both within and outside the database.

  * [Generate Embeddings](generate-embeddings.md)  
In these examples, you can see how to generate one or more vector embeddings
from an input text string.

  * [Perform Chunking With Embedding](perform-chunking-embedding.md)  
In these examples, you can see how to split text data (such as text strings
and full documents) into meaningful chunks and then represent each chunk as a
vector embedding.

  * [Configure Chunking Parameters](configure-chunking-parameters.md)  
Oracle AI Vector Search provides many parameters for chunking text data, such
as `SPLIT [BY]`, `OVERLAP`, or `NORMALIZE`. In these examples, you can see how
to configure these parameters to define your own chunking specifications and
strategies.

node.md "Oracle AI Vector Search offers Vector Utilities \(SQL and PL/SQL
tools\) to automatically generate vector embeddings from your unstructured
data, either within or outside Oracle Database.")
