## Generate Text

In these examples, you can see how to generate a textual answer, description,
or summary based on the specified task in the prompt.

A prompt can be an input text string, such as a question that you ask an LLM.
For example, "`What is Oracle Text?`". A prompt can also be a set of
instructions or a command, such as "`Summarize the following ...`", "`Draft an
email asking for ...`", or "`Rewrite the following ...`", and can include
results from a search.

  * [Generate Text Using the Local REST Provider Ollama](generate-text-locally-ollama.md)  
Perform a text-to-text transformation by accessing open LLMs, using the local
