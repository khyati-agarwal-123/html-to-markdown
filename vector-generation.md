## About Vector Generation

Learn about Vector Utility SQL functions and Vector Utility PL/SQL packages
that help you transform unstructured data into vector embeddings.

  * [Understand the Stages of Data Transformations](understand-stages-data-transformations.md)  
Your input data may travel through different stages before turning into a
vector.

  * [About SQL Functions to Generate Embeddings](sql-functions-generate-embeddings.md)  
Choose to implement Vector Utility SQL functions to perform parallel or on-
the-fly chunking and embedding operations, within the database. The supplied
SQL functions for vector generation are `VECTOR_CHUNKS` and
`VECTOR_EMBEDDING`.

  * [About PL/SQL Packages to Generate Embeddings](pl-sql-packages-generate-embeddings.md)  
Choose to implement Vector Utility PL/SQL packages to perform chunking,
embedding, and text generation operations along with text processing and
similarity search, both within and outside the database. The supplied PL/SQL
packages for vector generation are `DBMS_VECTOR` and `DBMS_VECTOR_CHAIN`.

node.md "Oracle AI Vector Search offers Vector Utilities \(SQL and PL/SQL
tools\) to automatically generate vector embeddings from your unstructured
data, either within or outside Oracle Database.")
